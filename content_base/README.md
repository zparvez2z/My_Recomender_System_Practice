Tried do some data analysis on "movie-lense" data set .Then tried to  build a content bases( item similarity based ) Recommender system on it.

In this notebook, I focused on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies. Keep in mind, this is not a true robust recommendation system, to describe it more accurately,it just tells you what movies/items are most similar to a particular movie choice.
